Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency. Make sure to allocate enough time for high-priority tasks and avoid procrastination.\n2. Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. This will help you stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n3. Set realistic goals and deadlines. Be sure to give yourself enough time to complete each task and don't set unrealistic expectations that can lead to stress and burnout.\n4. Use a calendar or planner to keep track of your schedule. Write down all your tasks, appointments, and deadlines in one place, and make sure to check it regularly for updates.\n5. Take breaks and practice self-care. It's important to give yourself time to rest and recharge throughout the day. Try taking short breaks every hour or so to stretch, move around, and clear your mind.\n6. Learn to say no. Don't take on too much by saying yes to every request that comes your way. Be mindful of your limits and prioritize your own tasks and well-being.\n7. Use technology to your advantage. There are many tools and apps available that can help you manage your time more effectively, such as Pomodoro timers, task management software, and scheduling apps. Experiment with different options until you find what works best for you.\n\nRemember, managing your time effectively is a process that takes time and effort to develop. Be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to try new approaches until you find a system that works for you."

        "ollama": "To add tasks to the app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Launch the personal productivity application.\n2. Initialize a new task by sending the command `/newtask [Title] [Description] [Deadline]`. For example: `/newtask Groceries Buy milk, bread, eggs 2023-04-15`\n3. The app will store the newly created task in the 'tasks.db' SQLite database. You can retrieve its details using SQL queries if needed.\n4. To display all tasks, send the command `/showall`. The app will return a list of currently available tasks along with their deadlines and statuses.\n5. If you need to update a task's deadline or status, use the commands `/update [Task ID] Deadline 2023-04-17` or `/update [Task ID] Status completed`. Replace [Task ID] with the ID of the task you wish to modify.\n6. You can also check a task's XP by using the command `/checkxp [Task ID]`. The app will return the current XP for that specific task.\n7. To view your chat history, use the command `/showhistory`. This will display all of your past conversations without overwriting any data in 'chat_history.json'.\n8. For debugging and optimization purposes, if you encounter issues with PyQt5, SQLite, or subprocess functions, provide detailed information about the problem along with any error messages for further investigation.\n9. If a user requests modifications to UI elements such as theme or page navigation, please make those changes only when explicitly requested and ensure that the app maintains its overall functionality."

Make sure to validate that the provided ID is an integer and exists in your tasks table to prevent errors."
